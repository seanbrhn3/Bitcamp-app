# Bitcamp-app

#This is the Bitcamp app for android. This is still in development and there are some things that need to be done before
#distributing to the public.

#EXPLANATION:
#The app first takes you to the home page which shows you the events, about, and faq button as well as the sign in button for the mentors.
#The first butttons will just take you to a page that shows what the button states. But the sign in button is where the magic happens.
#the mentor button will take you a sign in for each mentor. There they just put in a user name with there first name in it a password and then
#there skill so we know what they do. once thats done they and they sign in it will send them to a map tracking with there location showing their
#username and skill so campers can track them during the event instead of wasting precious time looking for help

#What needs to be worked on:
#mainly its the location stuff that needs to be worked on. You will see some errors coming from the trackMen page which may prevent the emulator from
#running.

#Also the database needs to be completed. I am using 000webhost to host it, its free so its good but if anyone wants to change it just contact me on slack and we
#can see what is best

#If you want add any cool features like a countdown clock that would be cool. okay have fun everyone!!!
